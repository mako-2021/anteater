## TeamAnteater animal quiz page 

## MVP- minimum viable project 

1. "As a user, I'd like to have a home page that contains all of the quizzes I can take on this website"
- Get a heroku page working
- Have easily readable (and clickable) buttons for each quiz 

2. "As a user, I'd like to see the question and the answers to choose from 
- Have a question, four answers + a submit button on the page
- When you hit the correct answer + submit, redirect to the next question in the quiz 
- A clickable footer that can take you back to the homepage (in case you've changed your mind about taking the quiz) 

3. "If I got the question wrong, I'd like the site to tell me"
- Alert the user "incorrect, try again!"

## Stretch 

1. Have more than one quiz

2. Have a decent amount of questions per quiz (more than two)
3. Keep score + return score once the user has finished the quiz 
- Route at the end of the quiz "you got 3/5!"  

4. Add some visual and aural extras
- Nice CSS layout
- JS? 
- Added sound effects (corresponding animal noise on correct answer?)

5. Timed game
- User has a certain amount of time to answer a question
